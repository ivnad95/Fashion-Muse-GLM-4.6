## üéØ What You Should Do Now

### Step 1: Understand the Project (30 minutes)

**Read in this order:**

1. **[IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** (15 min)
   - Get the big picture
   - Understand what will be built
   - See the timeline

2. **Skim [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md](./IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)** (15 min)
   - Read Phase 1 in detail
   - Skim other phases
   - Note the structure

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment (1 hour)

Follow the instructions in **[QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)** Day 1:

```bash
# 1. Copy environment template
cp env.template .env.local

# 2. Generate NextAuth secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# 3. Edit .env.local with required values
# - Add NEXTAUTH_SECRET
# - Set DATABASE_URL
# - Set NEXTAUTH_URL

# 4. Install and setup
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# 5. Start development
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Plan Your Approach (30 minutes)

**Open [PROGRESS_TRACKER.md](./PROGRESS_TRACKER.md)** and:

1. Review all phases
2. Estimate your available time
3. Decide your timeline
4. Mark current date as start date

**Questions to answer:**
- How many hours per day can you work on this?
- Are you working full-time or part-time on this?
- What's your target completion date?
- Which phases are most important to you?

### Step 4: Begin Implementation

**Follow [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)** starting with Day 1, Task 1.

**Implementation workflow:**
```
For each task:
1. Read task description in IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
2. Follow code examples in QUICK_START.md
3. Reference TECHNICAL_SPECS.md as needed
4. Write code and test
5. Check off in PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
6. Commit changes
7. Move to next task
```
